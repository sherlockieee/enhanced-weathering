My enhanced weathering papers.

NS166 Final Project estimates olivine particle size effectiveness for carbon capture. We calculate the trade-off between energy consumption of grinding olivine into smaller particle sizes versus the acceleration of weathering for smaller particles to determine which would have a higher life-cycle cost and thus, higher cost of carbon sequestration. 

NS111 Final Project compares the effect of basalt versus olivine's potential for carbon sequestration, assessing its scale, cost and secondary effect on the climate. 

Happy to discuss either papers in greater depth and/ or take criticism and feedback on the methodology/ results/ discussion. Contact info in my bio.
